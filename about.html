            I like to know people, travel, languages, understand the problems in the economy,
            <br>
            to motivate others, laugh, dance, swim, music, photography (even I don't have a
            <br>
            proper camera but someday soon).
            <br>
            <br>

            <br>
            with Europeans, Northamericas, Latinamericans and random people whitout specially
            <br>
            any clear flag or belong feeling.
