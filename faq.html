              My story starts very early, on 1997 I was a teenager that spended some months playing with HTML and JS.
              It was a hobbie that I enjoyed a lot. Then I stopped on 2001 because I started to study Economics.
              I still did like it to do websites and play a bit. But I never tought that I can live doing websites.
              I've learnt some Flash on 2002 and was doing websites for friends. I finaly finish my masters-degree
              I worked in Consulting, Marketing and PR. I realize that I was not satisfied working in these fields
              that I need something more challenging, that will fit better with me and something that can I can be
              passionate and also something that can give me at some level a lot of freedom and even be able to do
              my own Start-up. All the ways where going to web developement. That's how my path on Web Developement
              started in February 2014 as a Ruby Intern and
              in February 2015 as Ruby on Rails Junior Developer.
